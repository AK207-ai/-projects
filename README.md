Stock Market Price Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing historical stock market data using Python, with extensive use of the Pandas and NumPy libraries. The goal is to derive meaningful insights into stock trends, volatility, and correlations, making this project a great example of data manipulation and analysis.

Features
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handled missing values and ensured the dataset was ready for analysis.

Converted dates into a usable datetime format and set them as the index for time-series analysis.

2. Key Metrics and Calculations
Daily Returns: Calculated percentage changes in the closing price to analyze short-term gains or losses.

Moving Averages: Computed 50-day and 200-day moving averages to identify trends over time.

Volatility: Used rolling standard deviation of daily returns to measure price fluctuations.

3. Correlation Analysis
Examined relationships between key metrics (e.g., Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

4. Data Visualization
Plotted closing prices and moving averages to visualize trends.

Charted volatility over time to understand periods of high price movement.

Tech Stack
Python: The core programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

NumPy: For numerical computations and statistical measures.

Matplotlib: For creating insightful visualizations.
